# What about using a version of Virgil for shell-like scripting?
# E.g. a dynamically typed version, or one with more type inference
# that integrates with shell commands and has facilities for process
# control and text manipulation

import zfs;
import ls;

for f in (ls *.v3) {
	zfs -zb f;
}

# challenges:
# 1. how to access the input, output, and error streams of a process
# 2. what to do with the return code
# 3. integrate Virgil types and values to the basic languages
# 4. connect to and run Virgil programs
# 5. Asynchronous termination of processes
# 6. Pause, stop, kill other processes
# 7. Integrate with shell commands
# 8. Integrate options to shell commands to invocation syntax
# 9. Should there just be a Virgil shell?
